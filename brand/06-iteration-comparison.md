# Iteration Comparison

## Direction 1 Iterations

### D1-Iter1: Simplified Grid Bridge
- Removed explicit input lines — the grid IS the mark
- Three subtle source notches on left edge imply input without drawing full convergence lines
- Output area is a filled panel showing enriched data
- **Assessment**: Better than original — fewer parts, grid as hero. But the rectangular grid + output panel layout feels like a small UI mockup, not a mark. Still too "illustration-y."

### D1-Iter2: Pure Grid Bridge (Timeless)
- Maximum reduction: 3x2 grid. Left column = sources (varied gray), right column = output (unified emerald)
- No arrows, no lines, no decoration
- **Assessment**: Clean. Reads as "three things become three enriched things." But it's lost the "bridge" — now it's just a table. The directionality (left → right) requires context to understand. As a standalone mark, it's too abstract.

### D1 Verdict
Iter1 is the better of the two, but neither iteration solved the core problem: Direction 1's narrative requires too many visual elements to tell its story. When we simplify, we lose the story. When we keep the story, we have too many parts.

## Direction 2 Iterations

### D2-Iter1: Bridge Reframe
- Same 3x3 grid but reframed: columns are Source → Bridge → Output (left to right)
- Subtle directional lines between columns
- Source column varied opacity, bridge column stroke-only, output column emerald-filled
- **Assessment**: This is strong. The 3x3 grid now communicates "bridge" via left-to-right progression. Three rows = three data channels. Three columns = source → process → output. The grid reads both as a data structure AND as a pipeline. The directional lines are subtle enough not to add clutter but clear enough to imply flow.

### D2-Iter2: Minimal 3-Column Bridge (Timeless)
- Stripped all decoration. Just 9 rectangles with clear differentiation: filled gray → outlined → emerald-filled
- **Assessment**: The purest expression. Works at 16x16 (just 9 tiny squares with left-gray, center-outlined, right-green). In monochrome, left=filled, center=outlined, right=filled-with-different-weight. Survives everywhere. But: is it too minimal? Does it need at least ONE enrichment indicator to show that the output is "enriched" vs just "forwarded"?

### D2 Verdict
D2-Iter2 is the winner. It's the most reducible, most scalable, most ownable. The three-column progression (filled → outlined → emerald) tells the bridge story through pure structure. Adding the enrichment dots from D2-Iter1 in the output column would be the one enhancement worth considering.

## Final Hybrid: D2-Iter2 + Enrichment Dots

The winning mark is **D2-Iter2 with enrichment indicators in the output column**:
- 3x3 grid
- Left column: filled gray (varied tones) = diverse data sources
- Center column: outlined = the bridge (processing/normalization layer)
- Right column: emerald-filled with centered dots = enriched output

This mark:
1. Communicates "bridge" through left-to-right progression
2. Communicates "enrichment" through the output column treatment
3. Is pixel-aligned and survives at 16x16
4. Works in monochrome (filled → outlined → filled-different)
5. Is specific to this product class (data pipeline with enrichment)
6. Has a compact, memorable shape (square grid)
7. Extends naturally to the wordmark (monospace, structured)

The runner-up is D1-Iter1 (simplified grid bridge with source notches), which tells the story more explicitly but has more parts and weaker small-size performance.

## Iteration 3: Tighten the Core Mark

Applied to the winning D2-Iter2 + Enrichment Dots mark:

### Changes
1. **Source column gradient reordered**: dark→mid→light (top-to-bottom) instead of arbitrary. Creates a logical data-depth progression — raw/opaque sources at top, lighter/processed at bottom.
2. **Grid coordinates adjusted**: Cells shifted from (7,7)→(5,5) and (43,y)→(45,y) for slightly wider inter-column gaps vs intra-column spacing, visually grouping each column.
3. **Output column presence strengthened**: fill-opacity increased from 0.2→0.3. The emerald read was too subtle against dark backgrounds; 0.3 balances visibility without overwhelming the grid structure.
4. **Enrichment dots enlarged**: r=2.5→3. Better visibility at medium sizes (64-128px) without dominating at large sizes.
5. **Monochrome mark fixed**: Output column changed from stroke-only (stroke-width=2) to filled (fill="#94a3b8" fill-opacity="0.3" + stroke). Maintains the filled→outlined→filled-different story in grayscale.
6. **Favicon 32px grid symmetry**: Output column width corrected from 8px→7px to match source/bridge columns. The asymmetry was noticeable at small sizes.
7. **Favicon 16px**: Output fill-opacity increased from 0.3→0.4 for stronger emerald read at minimum size.

### Assessment
These are refinement-level changes, not direction changes. The mark's identity and semantic structure are unchanged. Every change improves craft fidelity (pixel alignment, color hierarchy, cross-size consistency) without adding complexity.

## Iteration 4: Refine Compound Assets

### Banner (readme-banner.svg)
1. **Composition tightened**: Mark and text shifted 20px closer together (text x: 310→290) for better visual weight distribution.
2. **Flow arrows added**: Subtle 4px lines between mark columns (opacity 0.4-0.5) hint at data flow direction in the larger banner context. These are banner-only — not present in the mark itself.
3. **Architecture diagram readability**: Opacity increased from 0.35→0.45 — the text was barely visible, defeating the purpose of the supporting diagram.
4. **Tool count corrected**: "56 MCP tools"→"75 MCP tools" to match actual codebase (the 56 count was from the REST API endpoints, not MCP tools).

### OG Card (og-card.svg)
1. **Mark-to-text gap reduced**: Mark scale reduced from 5→4.5, text x shifted from 460→400. Closes the dead space that made the composition feel split in two.
2. **Separators unified**: Changed from pipe characters ("|") with mixed font-families to centered dots ("·") with consistent `'SF Mono'` stack. Cleaner, more typographically correct.
3. **Tool count corrected**: "56 tools"→"75 tools".
4. **Badge positioning adjusted**: Version and language badges moved left to align with new text position.

### Lockups
1. **Wordmark vertical centering**: Name baseline moved from y=37→35, tagline from y=54→52. The text pair now sits at optical center relative to the mark height.
2. **Light-mode source gradient**: Reordered to match dark-mode logic (lightest→mid→darkest top-to-bottom, inverted for light backgrounds).
3. **All lockups use updated mark coordinates** (Iter 3 cell positions).
