# Session Manual — February 20, 2026

## What Was Done Today

### 1. AGENTS.md Rewritten (7-agent -> 16-agent roster)

**File:** `AGENTS.md` (repo root)

The team roster was expanded from 7 agents to 15 agents + 1 human (you). This is the central document that every agent reads before working.

**New sections added:**
- **Monthly Compute Budget** — your actual subscription costs (~$479/mo breakdown)
- **Cost-Aware Routing** — 14 task types mapped to cheapest capable agent
- **Tool Mastery Targets** — what each agent (and you) should specialize in
- **Orchestration Plan** — 4-tier complexity routing, parallel execution model, weekly rhythm
- **Windsurf Architectural Positioning** — where Windsurf fits vs Claude Code vs Antigravity
- **Agent Handshakes** — A2A-inspired capability verification protocol
- **Task Orchestration Process Charts** — business flow + technical flow + 12 failure modes

**Agents added:** Qodo Gen (#8), Windsurf (#9), v0 (#10), GHAS (#11), NotebookLM (#12), Antigravity (#13), Amazon Q (#14), Mintlify (#15)

**Agents removed:** Aider, Cursor, Snyk (standalone)

### 2. Copilot Agent Profiles Updated

**Files:** `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (4 files)

All 4 Copilot custom agent profiles (backend-dev, frontend-dev, test-writer, ops-engineer) were rewritten to:
- Identify Copilot as Agent #5 on the 15-agent team
- Include team awareness (who else works in their scope)
- Reference AGENTS.md for full context
- Clarify review chain (Claude Code reviews, human merges)

### 3. Handshake Propagation Guide Created

**File:** `HANDSHAKE.md` (repo root)

Contains copy-paste agent cards for every agent that needs manual propagation. Includes:
- Status tracker table (check off as you go)
- Handshake prompt template (6-question acknowledgment)
- Per-agent cards with role, scope, off-limits, acceptance test
- 4-wave execution order

## Your Roster

| # | Agent | Cost | What It Does |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | You (dotcal604) | — | Orchestrate, write specs, review PRs, approve merges |
| 2 | Claude Code | $200/mo shared | Staff engineer — complex work, MCP tools, exec-critical |
| 3 | Claude Desktop | $200/mo shared | Pair programming partner, strategy sessions |
| 4 | ChatGPT | $200/mo shared | Architecture review, second opinions |
| 5 | Copilot | $39/mo flat | Pattern-following code, tests, boilerplate |
| 6 | Codex | $200/mo shared | Spec execution from detailed issues (async) |
| 7 | Jules | $20/mo shared | Probationary — JSDoc, docs, Python (needs 3 clean PRs) |
| 8 | Qodo Gen | Free | Test generation, edge case discovery |
| 9 | Windsurf | Free/Pro | IDE flow state, module-level refactoring |
| 10 | v0 | Free | UI component generation from specs |
| 11 | GHAS | Free | Security scanning in CI (automated) |
| 12 | NotebookLM | $20/mo shared | Knowledge queries, architecture RAG |
| 13 | Antigravity | $20/mo shared | Autonomous multi-file features |
| 14 | Amazon Q | Free | CI/CD, GitHub Actions, deploy scripts |
| 15 | Mintlify | Free | Docs site hosting, auto-deploy |

**Total: ~$479/mo** (Claude Max $200 + ChatGPT Pro $200 + Copilot $39 + Google AI Pro $20 + Perplexity $20)

## How to Use Each Agent

### Daily workflow
1. **Write issues** on GitHub with detailed specs (file paths, acceptance criteria)
2. **Assign** to the right agent based on the cost-aware routing table in AGENTS.md
3. **Claude Code** works interactively in your terminal
4. **Async agents** (Codex, Copilot, Jules, Antigravity) produce PRs you batch-review
5. **Claude Code auto-reviews** all agent PRs before you see them
6. **You merge** — no agent merges their own PR

### When to use which agent

| You need... | Use this agent |
|-------------|---------------|
| Complex debugging, architecture, MCP tools | Claude Code (#2) |
| Second opinion on a design | Claude Desktop (#3) or ChatGPT (#4) |
| Boilerplate, test files, pattern-following | Copilot (#5) |
| Isolated single-file task from a detailed spec | Codex (#6) |
| JSDoc, docs, Python scripts (low risk) | Jules (#7) |
| Edge case tests for an existing module | Qodo Gen (#8) |
| Refactoring in flow state (hands-on-keyboard) | Windsurf (#9) |
| New UI component from a design spec | v0 (#10) |
| Security scan | GHAS (#11) — automatic in CI |
| "How does X work?" about the codebase | NotebookLM (#12) |
| Big multi-file feature (autonomous) | Antigravity (#13) |
| GitHub Actions workflow, deploy script | Amazon Q (#14) |
| Documentation pages | Mintlify (#15) + Codex (#6) for content |

## Next Steps (What To Do Now)

### Immediate (today)

1. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\dotca\source\market-data-bridge
   git add AGENTS.md HANDSHAKE.md .github/agents/
   git commit -m "Rewrite AGENTS.md: 16-agent roster with cost routing, orchestration, handshakes"
   git push
   ```

2. **Connect Mintlify** (if not done yet):
   - Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Select `market-data-bridge` repo
   - Point at `docs/` directory
   - Verify deployment

### This week (Wave 1-2 handshakes)

3. **Run Wave 2 handshakes** (open `HANDSHAKE.md` and follow the guide):
   - Assign Codex its acceptance test (Zod schema for Holly alerts)
   - Open project in Windsurf, paste its agent card
   - Open project in Antigravity, paste its agent card
   - Install Amazon Q extension, paste its agent card
   - Install Qodo Gen extension, generate tests for risk-gate.ts

4. **Run Wave 3 handshakes** (manual paste):
   - Claude Desktop: paste card in Cowork session
   - ChatGPT: paste card in chat
   - Jules: paste card at jules.google
   - v0: paste component spec at v0.dev

### Next Monday (first orchestrated week)

5. **Plan your first orchestrated week:**
   - Write 3-5 detailed GitHub issues
   - Assign each to the right agent per the routing table
   - Run Claude Code interactively for the complex work
   - Let async agents produce PRs
   - Friday: batch-review all agent PRs

| `HANDSHAKE.md` | Agent cards + propagation guide (for you) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project-specific Claude Code instructions |
| `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Copilot custom agent profiles (4 files) |
| `docs/` | Mintlify documentation site (27 pages) |
| `docs/docs.json` | Mintlify navigation config |

## Your Mastery Investment

The single highest-leverage thing you can improve is **spec-writing quality**. Every minute spent writing a clear issue with file paths, acceptance criteria, and scope boundaries saves 10 minutes of agent rework and review. This is your mastery domain.

**What good specs look like:**
```markdown
## Title: Add loading skeleton to eval history page

**Agent:** Antigravity (#13)
**Files to modify:** frontend/src/app/evals/page.tsx
**Files to reference:** frontend/src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx (existing pattern)

**What to do:**
1. Add a loading state that shows while useEvalHistory() is fetching
2. Use shadcn Skeleton component (already installed)
3. Match the table layout with skeleton rows

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Named export, "use client" directive
- [ ] Dark theme (bg-card, text-muted-foreground)
- [ ] Skeleton matches table column widths
- [ ] tsc --noEmit clean
- [ ] No console.log
```

**What bad specs look like:**
```
Make the eval page load faster
```

The difference between these two specs is the difference between a 1-hour PR and a 3-round rework cycle.
