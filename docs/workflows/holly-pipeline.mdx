# Holly AI Pipeline

## Overview

Holly AI is Trade Ideas' AI-powered alert system. EvalEngine ingests Holly alerts, scores them through the 3-model ensemble, and surfaces high-confidence signals.

```
Trade Ideas → CSV Export → holly_import → Auto-Eval → Signal Feed → Bracket Order
```

## Step 1: Import alerts

### Manual CSV import
Export alerts from Trade Ideas as CSV, then:
```
MCP tool: holly_import
Parameter: csv (full CSV content)
```

### File import
```
MCP tool: holly_trade_import_file
Parameter: file_path (/path/to/export.csv)
```

The importer parses Trade Ideas' non-standard CSV format, computes derived metrics (hold time, MFE, MAE, giveback, R-multiple), and stores in the `holly_trades` table.

## Step 2: Auto-evaluation

When enabled, the auto-eval pipeline automatically evaluates new Holly alerts:

```
MCP tool: auto_eval_toggle
Parameter: enabled: true
```

Each alert goes through:
1. **Pre-filter** — skip if symbol was recently evaluated (dedup window)
2. **Feature extraction** — gap %, RVOL, spread, float rotation, extension
3. **3-model ensemble** — Claude + GPT-4o + Gemini score 0–100
4. **Weighted average** — ensemble score with disagreement penalty
5. **Signal generation** — stored in signal feed with go/no-go verdict

Check pipeline status: `auto_eval_status`

## Step 3: Review signals

Navigate to `/signals` to see scored alerts:
- **Score** — ensemble weighted average (0–100)
- **Direction** — long or short
- **Should trade** — go/no-go based on score threshold
- **Symbol** — with current quote data

Or query via MCP: `signal_feed` with optional `since`, `symbol`, `direction` filters.

## Step 4: Execute

For high-confidence signals, execute with full bracket protection:

```
MCP tool: place_advanced_bracket
Parameters:
  symbol: "AAPL"
  action: "BUY"
  quantity: 100          # from size_position
  entry: { type: "LMT", price: 185.50 }
  takeProfit: { type: "LMT", price: 187.00 }
  stopLoss: { type: "TRAIL", trailingPercent: 0.5 }
```

## Holly segments

Your data shows a clear edge difference between Holly segments:

| Segment | Win Rate | Avg R | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Holly Grail | 52.3% | +0.025 | Prioritize |
| Holly Neo | 48.0% | −0.009 | Reduce or skip |

## Key strategies

Top performing Holly strategies (from your autopsy data):
- **Tailwind** — momentum continuation
- **Pullback Long** — dip buying in uptrend
- **Breakdown Short** — breakdown from consolidation

Check strategy rankings: `/holly/autopsy` or MCP `holly_exit_autopsy`
