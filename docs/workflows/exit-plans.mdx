# Exit Plans

Exit plans attach to bracket orders and provide structured exit policies based on Holly autopsy data.

## Creating an exit plan

```
MCP tool: exit_plan_create
Parameters:
  correlation_id: "bracket-123"   # from place_advanced_bracket
  symbol: "AAPL"
  direction: "long"
  total_shares: 100
  entry_price: 185.00
  hard_stop: 183.50
  strategy: "Tailwind"            # Holly strategy name
```

The plan auto-generates:
- **TP ladder** — scale-out targets at 1R, 2R, 3R
- **Trailing stop** — tightens as price moves in your favor
- **Protect trigger** — moves stop to breakeven after 1R reached
- **Time stop** — max hold time before forced exit

## Exit plan lifecycle

```
draft → active → protecting → scaling → exited
                                      → cancelled
```

1. **Draft** — created, waiting for entry fill
2. **Active** — entry filled, monitoring price
3. **Protecting** — breakeven stop activated
4. **Scaling** — partial TP fills taken
5. **Exited** — position closed (TP, SL, or manual)

Activate after fill: `exit_plan_activate` with actual entry price.

## Tracking overrides

When you deviate from the plan (moved stop, took early profit, froze), record it:

```
MCP tool: exit_plan_record_override
Parameters:
  exit_plan_id: "uuid-here"
  field: "hard_stop"
  old_value: "183.50"
  new_value: "182.00"
  reason: "tilt"          # revenge, too_early, too_late, freeze, tilt, news, technical
```

This builds a behavioral profile — the analytics page shows override frequency and which reasons cost you the most.

## Closing a plan

```
MCP tool: exit_plan_close
Parameters:
  id: "uuid-here"
  exit_price: 187.25
  reason: "tp_filled"     # tp_filled, sl_filled, manual, flatten, cancelled
```

Auto-calculates R-multiple and giveback ratio.
