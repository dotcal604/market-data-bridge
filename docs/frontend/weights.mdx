# Weights (`/weights`)

Controls how much influence each model has on the ensemble score.

## Current Weights
Shows Claude, GPT-4o, and Gemini weights (sum to 1.0) plus the disagreement penalty factor (k).

## Simulate
Test different weight configurations against historical data:
- Adjust sliders for each model
- See simulated vs current avg score, trade rate, and accuracy
- Compare before committing

## Weight History
Audit trail of all weight changes with timestamp, source (manual/recalibration/simulation), sample size, and the weights at each point.

## Auto-tune
`tune_risk_params` uses half-Kelly sizing from the last 100 outcomes to automatically optimize weights.
