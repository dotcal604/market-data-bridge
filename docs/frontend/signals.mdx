# Signals (`/signals`)

Signals are Holly alerts that have been scored through the 3-model ensemble.

## Signal Table
Each signal shows:
- **Symbol** — ticker with current quote
- **Direction** — long or short
- **Ensemble score** — weighted average (0–100)
- **Should trade** — go/no-go verdict based on threshold
- **Strategy** — Holly strategy that generated the alert
- **Timestamp**

## Filtering
Filter by symbol, direction, or date range. Only shows signals from the auto-eval pipeline — manual evaluations appear on `/evals`.
