# My Analytics (`/analytics`)

The analytics page visualizes your actual trading data to build conviction around behavioral changes. It pulls from 1,400+ TraderSync trades and 10,000+ Holly trades.

## Overview Stats

Six KPI cards across the top:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Net P&L (All Time)** | Total dollars made/lost across all trades |
| **Last 30 Days** | Recent performance trend |
| **Win Rate** | Overall win percentage with W/L count |
| **Avg R-Multiple** | Risk-adjusted return per trade |
| **Commissions** | Total commission drag (highlighted if > profit) |
| **Holly Trades** | Holly trade count with win rate and profit factor |

## Key Insights

Auto-generated, color-coded insight cards that identify your specific leaks and edges:

- **Red cards** — dangers (9 AM leak, commission drag, giveback problem)
- **Green cards** — edges (short outperformance, Holly Grail advantage)
- **Blue cards** — actions (best trading hours to concentrate on)

These are computed from your actual trade data, not generic advice.

## Holly AI Section

When Holly trade data exists, two additional visualizations appear:

### Giveback Distribution
Bucket chart showing what percentage of trades give back 0–20%, 20–40%, etc. of their peak profit. High giveback = you're not exiting well enough.

### Strategy Rankings
Top 8 Holly strategies ranked by total P&L with inline spark bars. Each row shows trade count, win rate, Sharpe ratio, and giveback percentage.
