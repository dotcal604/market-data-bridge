# Drift Monitor (`/drift`)

Detects when models lose accuracy over time.

## Model Health Cards
Three cards (one per model) showing rolling accuracy over last 50, 20, and 10 evaluations. Color-coded: green = healthy, yellow = warning, red = drift detected.

## Drift Report
- **Rolling accuracy** — per model over configurable windows
- **Calibration error** — by score decile (are high scores actually winning?)
- **Regime detection** — identifies market regime shifts

## Drift Alerts
Historical alerts triggered when accuracy or calibration metrics fell below thresholds. Shows alert type, model, metric values, and timestamps.
