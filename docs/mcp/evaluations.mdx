# Evaluation Tools

## Evaluation data

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `eval_stats` | Total evaluations, average scores, win rate, model accuracy |
| `eval_outcomes` | Evaluations joined with trade outcomes (scores + R-multiples) |
| `eval_reasoning` | Per-model key drivers, risk factors, uncertainties, conviction |
| `record_outcome` | Record trade result for an evaluation |

## Drift detection

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `drift_report` | Rolling accuracy, calibration error by score decile, regime detection |
| `drift_alerts` | Recent alerts when accuracy fell below thresholds |
| `drift_check` | Run drift report + alert check in one call |

## Weight management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `simulate_weights` | Test different model weights against historical data |
| `weight_history` | Audit trail of weight changes |
| `tune_risk_params` | Auto-tune using half-Kelly sizing from last 100 outcomes |

## Edge validation

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `edge_report` | Sharpe, Sortino, win rate, profit factor, max DD, feature attribution, walk-forward |
| `walk_forward` | Walk-forward backtest with train/test windows |
