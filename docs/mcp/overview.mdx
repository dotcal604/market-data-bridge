# MCP Tools Overview

EvalEngine exposes 150+ tools via the Model Context Protocol. These tools are available in Claude Code and Claude Desktop when the MCP server is configured.

## Tool categories

| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| [Market Data](/mcp/market-data) | 15 | Quotes, bars, options, screeners, news |
| [Orders](/mcp/orders) | 12 | Place, modify, cancel orders and brackets |
| [Account](/mcp/account) | 10 | Positions, P&L, exposure, stress testing |
| [Evaluations](/mcp/evaluations) | 12 | Ensemble scoring, outcomes, drift, weights |
| [Holly](/mcp/holly) | 18 | Alerts, trades, autopsy, predictor, rules |
| [Analytics](/mcp/analytics) | 10 | Daily summary, journal, history, edge report |
| [Risk](/mcp/risk) | 10 | Session guards, position sizing, risk config |

## First call: `get_status`

Always call `get_status` first. It returns:
- `easternTime` — current Eastern time
- `marketSession` — pre-market, regular, after-hours, or closed
- `ibkr.connected` — whether TWS is live

If IBKR is disconnected, account/order tools will fail. Market data falls back to Yahoo.

## Tool naming convention

Tools use `snake_case` names grouped by function:
- `get_*` — read data
- `place_*` / `cancel_*` — order actions
- `subscribe_*` / `unsubscribe_*` — streaming
- `holly_*` — Holly AI tools
- `session_*` — session risk gate
- `exit_plan_*` — exit plan management
