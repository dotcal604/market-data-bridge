# What is EvalEngine?

EvalEngine is a personal trading infrastructure that connects Interactive Brokers (TWS/Gateway) to a 3-model AI ensemble (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini) for trade evaluation, automated signal processing, and performance analytics.

## What it does

- **Evaluates trades** through a 3-model ensemble that scores setups 0–100 and produces a go/no-go verdict
- **Processes Holly AI alerts** from Trade Ideas and auto-evaluates them through the ensemble pipeline
- **Executes bracket orders** on IBKR with position sizing, trailing stops, and exit plans
- **Tracks performance** across 1,400+ TraderSync trades and 10,000+ Holly trades
- **Serves 150+ MCP tools** so Claude Code and Claude Desktop can interact with markets, orders, and analytics
