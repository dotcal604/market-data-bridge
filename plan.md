# Plan

This file previously tracked the trading execution + collab channel implementation (both complete).

Active planning is now tracked in:
- **ROADMAP.md** — phases, backlog, agent delegation strategy
- **GitHub Issues** — individual tasks (#6-#10 are Phase 2 agent tasks)
- **GitHub PRs** — agent-submitted work (#11, #12, #13 from Copilot)
